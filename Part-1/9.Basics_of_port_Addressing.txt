What actually happens (deriving from analogy)

suppose a parcel have reached u from anthor state or country

Reaching our city = reaching our network(IP Address)
Reaching our apartment = reaching the host(MAC Address)
Reaching the right person = Reaching the right process(port Address)

Port address or Port number
-----------------------------------------------------
*In a node many processes will be running.
*Data which are sent/received must reach the right process.
*Every process in a node is uniquely identified using port number.
*port = communication endpoint.
*Fixed port numbers and dynamic port numbers(0 - 65535)


Before sending dta, any node must
*Attach source IP address and destination IP address.
*Attach source MAC address and destination MAC address.
*Attach source port number and destination port number.
