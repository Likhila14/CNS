Network Topology
---------------------------------
Arrange of nodes of a computer netwok.
simply---> Topology = Layout.

Topology can be physical and logical

Physical Topology and Logical topology
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Physical Topology - Placement of various nodes.
Logical Topology - Deals with the data flow in the network.

Various Network Topologies
--------------------------------------------------
-->Bus
-->Ring
-->Star
-->Mesh
-->Hybrid

1.Bus Topology
-------------------------------
*All data transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over 
this common transmission medium and is able to received by all nodes 
in the network simultaneously.
*A signal containing the adress of the intended receiving machine 
travels from a source machine in both directions to all machines 
connected to the bus until it finds the intended recipient.

advantages : only one wire (less expensive)
                       suited for temporary network.
                        Node failures does not affect others.

disadvantages: Not fault tolerant (No redundancy)
                          Limited cable length.
                          No security.

       ---------------------|----------|----------------------

2.Ring Topology
-------------------------------
*A ring topology  is a bus topology in a closed loop.
*peer-to-peer LAN topology.
*Two connections : one to each of its nearest neighbors.
*Unidirectional.
*Sending and receiving data takes palce with the help of a TOKEN.

advantages : Performance is better than Bus topology.
                      Can cause battleneck due to weak links.
                      All nodes with equal access.

disadvantanges: Unidirectional.Single point of failure will affect the 
                            whole network.
                            Increases in load so decreases in performance.
                            No security.

3.Star Topology
------------------------------
* Every node is connected to a central node called a hub or switch.
*Centeralized Management.
* All traffic must pass through the hub or switch.

advantages: Easy to design and implement.
                      Centeralized adminstration.
                      Scalable.

disadvantages: Single point of failure affects the whole network.
                          Bottlenecks due to overloaded switch/Hub.
                          Increased cost due to switch/hub.

We have extended star Topology which is joined two star network by 
repeater.


4.Mesh Topology
--------------------------------
*Each node is directly connected to every other nodes in the network.
*Fault tolerant and reliable.

advantages : Fault tolerant
                      Reliable

disadvantages: Issues with broadcasting messages.
                          Expensive and impractical for large network.

Hybrid Topology
-----------------------------------
 Hybrid topology contains one or more types of topologies.
