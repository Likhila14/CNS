Switching
--------------------

*Switching in computer network helps in deciding the best route for data
transmission if there are multiple paths in a larger network.
* one - to -one connection.

Switching techniques
-----------------------------------------
1. circuit switching
2. Message switching
3.Packet  switching
         *Datagram approach
         * Virtual circuit Approach

1. Circuit Switching
------------------------------------
*A dedicated path is established between the sender and receiver.
*Before data tranfer,connection will be established first.
* eg: Telephone network.

3 phases in circuit switching 
   1. connection established.
   2.Data transfer.
   3.Connection Disconnection.

2. Message Switching
---------------------------------------
* Store and forward mechanism.
*Message is transffered as a complete unit and forwarded using store
  and forward mechanism at the intermediary node.
* Not suited for streaming media and real-time applications.
